8/25/23, 16:24 - Ishant: Thank you. It's crucial to understand that social and economic disparities, lack of education, and misinformation can contribute to such tensions, making people feel beaten down and victimized. Strengthening these aspects might prevent future conflicts.

8/25/23, 16:48 - Shivang: And let's not forget the power of community engagement. When individuals from different backgrounds come together for dialogue and collaboration, it's harder for animosity to take root, preventing people from feeling isolated and depressed.
